<p>Unstructured data is growing exponentially year after year with the 
advanced capabilities of modern devices. These devices generate mass 
quantities of emails, images and audio and video files. Growing pools of
 unstructured data become difficult to organize, manage and search. This
 is where object storage comes in. Object storage is ideal for 
organizing, managing and searching through high volumes (200 TB+) of 
diverse and unstructured data. Object storage platforms also give 
companies the ability to start making sense of the big data they have at
 hand and extract insights that aid in the development of business 
goals.</p>

<span id="more-6509"></span>

<h4>1. Custom Metadata &amp; Searchability</h4>

<P> When it comes to object storage, metadata resides in the objects 
themselves. There is no need to build databases to associate metadata 
with the objects. Custom metadata can be created about an object file 
based on contents, dates, user information, permissions, etc. Attributes
 can be changed and added over time. Because of custom metadata, object 
storage is highly searchable. Users can conduct searches that return a 
set of files that meet specific criteria, such as what percentage of 
files are of a certain type or created by certain owner. This allows 
companies to extract insights from the big data they possess within 
their files and identify trends.

<h4>2. Resiliency</h4>

<P> When an object is created, it is copied to one or more nodes depending 
on the policies in place. Nodes are normally spread out geographically, 
allowing for automatic, cost-effective disaster recovery for object 
files.

<h4>3. Archive Management</h4>

<P> Because of its custom metadata and resiliency, object storage systems 
are ideal for digitizing and storing old documents and audio and video 
content.

<h4>4. Automated Information Life Cycle Management</h4>

<P> Object files can manage, repair, retire, delete and deduplicate 
themselves based on information provided in metadata, making information
 life cycle management extremely efficient.

<h4>5. Unlimited Scalability</h4>

<P> As object storage grows, it can be scaled out horizontally by adding 
nodes. Metadata stays with objects, allowing for a flat system, often 
referred to as storage pools. In flat data environments, scalability is 
virtually unlimited. Unlike traditional storage, object storage does not
 become inefficient and difficult to manage with large volumes of data.

<h4>6. Cost-effective</h4>

<P> Part of what makes object storage cost-effective is that less hardware 
is needed for large volumes of data. Also, object storage is often 
acquired as an OpEx solution, using a pay-as-you-go model in the cloud.

<h4>7. Convenient</h4>

<P> <p>Object storage fits the needs of an increasingly mobile workforce. 
Because of the HTTP interface, object files have a unique URL can be 
accessed from anywhere in the world and from any device.</p>

<p>In conclusion, object storage is perfect for large volumes of 
unstructured data that don't need to be modified frequently. It can take
 awhile after updating object files to see changes in all replicas, 
which is referred to as "eventual consistency". This means object 
storage is not the best system for data that comes from rapid read/write
 applications. Best types of content for object storage are media, web 
content, archives, documents, log files and device-generated data.</p>

<p>Object storage platforms and their capabilities vary by vendor. To 
find the best one to meet your company's needs, check vendors' options 
for redundancy, encryption and interoperability.</p>

storage

<P><b>Abstract:</b> Learn how scale-out NAS and object storage systems work, their pros 
and cons, manageability and how they integrate with your storage infrastructure.</p>

<p>The growth of unstructured data continues unabated, with no end in sight. Over the 
last decade, email, videos,...</p>

<p>tweets, photos and more -- all created by human hands -- have been key generators of 
all this unstructured information. As smartphone adoption reaches maturity worldwide, 
you'd think unstructured data growth would start to moderate. Think again.</p>

<p>As the internet of things kicks in, machine-generated data will soon dwarf data 
generated by humans. Whether you are talking about video surveillance, smart cars, 
elevators, refrigerators, traffic meters or other smart devices, it seems they already 
(or will soon) have the power to measure and monitor something. Combine this capability 
with ubiquitous and inexpensive internet access and you will find that these machines 
are sending information to data centers worldwide at an alarming rate.</p> 

<p>At the turn of the century, scale-out NAS easily handled this onslaught of 
predominately human-generated unstructured data. But as global <a href="http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/definition/public-cloud-storage">public 
cloud services</a> exploded, a new type of storage was required, hence the industry's 
invention of object storage.</p> 

<p>To help you choose the right option for your needs, I explain how scale-out NAS and <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Managing-data-with-an-object-storage-system">object storage work</a>,
 their relative strengths and weaknesses, how easy or difficult they are
 to manage, and how well they integrate with existing infrastructure and
 other architectural considerations.</p>

<h4 class="section-title"><i class="icon" data-icon="1"></i>How scale-out NAS works</h4>
 
<p>If you use a personal computer, you are familiar with a file system.
 It is a mechanism for easily storing and organizing different types of 
data by structuring information in a humanly readable manner. A 
scale-out NAS device is like your C: drive on steroids: a singular, 
massive system that can store millions, or even billions, of files. 
Scale-out means it operates as one very large global namespace across 
multiple individual servers or nodes. The data is stored in a relative 
hierarchical fashion, meaning the location and name of a file depends on
 where it is structurally located within a system of folders and 
subfolders.</p>
 
<p>First-generation, multinode scale-out NAS devices improved 
scalability of single file systems, but typically at the expense of 
small file performance. In addition, performance would also 
significantly slow as the total number of files increased (especially <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/feature/Object-stores-metadata-create-smart-storage-systems">metadata searches</a>).
 Recent generations greatly improved small file performance with the use
 of flash-first designs for metadata management with ever faster 
inter-nodal network speeds. So, today, some modern scale-out NAS devices
 can easily store billions of files without compromising the speed of 
metadata searches.</p>

<h4 class="section-title"><i class="icon" data-icon="1"></i>Key strengths of scale-out NAS</h4>
 
<p><b>Hierarchical and humanly readable metadata. </b>Through a simple 
file system browser, you can see descriptions of file names and easily 
organize these descriptive files into descriptive folders. For example, 
you can copy a photograph named "IMG_XXX" into a folder where you can 
effortlessly rename it "Aunt Alice at Disneyland - May of 2016." You can
 also store that file in a folder called "2016 Pictures." One popular 
use case for scale-out NAS is for consolidating departmental file shares
 and home directories for thousands of employees. That way, IT 
administrators can centrally manage, secure and back up all this data.</p>
 
<p><b>POSIX-compliant file access.</b> This feature is critical for thousands of legacy applications written to the <a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/definition/POSIX">Portable Operating System Interface</a>
 (POSIX) standard, which allows companies to centrally manage security 
and file access and ensures that multiple applications can share a 
scale-out NAS device without one application overwriting a file another 
is using.</p>
 
<p>Another key <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync" target="_blank">feature</a>, called fsync, makes sure that when a file is written, the data is fully protected from a power loss.</p>
 
<p><b>Performance with real-time data consistency.</b> Through the use 
of a real-time metadata locking system, multiple applications or users 
are inherently forbidden to write to the same data at the same time. 
This allows for updates to files without fear of simultaneous changes by
 another application, which would leave files corrupt or out of sync.</p>
 
<p>Vendors of scale-out NAS products include: EMC Isilon, IBM Spectrum Scale, Qumulo and Scality.</p>

<section class="section main-article-chapter" data-menu-title="How object storage works">
 
<h4 class="section-title"><i class="icon" data-icon="1"></i>How object storage works</h4>
 
<p>When scale-out NAS could not keep pace with emerging web-scale 
requirements, a new access method called object storage emerged, which 
added <a href="http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/podcast/Cloud-object-storage-makes-scalability-a-reality-An-expert-podcast">global scalability</a>
 but relinquished easy file access. Object storage lacks the hierarchal 
(and more complex) metadata attributes controlled through the POSIX 
standard, and it features very few commands (e.g., Put, Get, Delete) to 
keep the interface extremely simple to use.</p>
 
<p>Command simplicity also means that objects now exist in a single 
flat address space, each with a unique identifier. This simplifies 
management of high-level metadata as the same unique identifier is used 
to retrieve the object data. The power of this simple concept is in 
retrieving data without the need to know how or where the underlying 
data is stored.</p>

  </div>
 <div class="main-article-image-mask"></div></figure>
 
<p>Each object also contains an extended set of metadata (much more 
metadata than a traditional file system) that can richly describe object
 contents. Objects can now be self-describing and can include 
application-specific details required to interpret the data. Because 
there is no limit to the contents or length of the metadata, programmers
 can add a rich set of information about the object itself.</p>
 
<p>Extended commands allow for the retrieval of metadata, which assists
 in cataloging and maintaining what is stored in an object. Object 
location lookup, meanwhile, is simple to process and knowledge of every 
object's location isn't required or maintained by every node in the 
system. This allows object storage to scale out to an almost unlimited 
size.</p>

<section class="section main-article-chapter" data-menu-title="Key strengths of object storage devices">
 
<h4 class="section-title"><i class="icon" data-icon="1"></i>Key strengths of object storage devices</h4>
 
<p><b>Global distribution and scale. </b>Object storage's <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Big-players-target-object-storage-at-cloud-and-archive">simple indexing scheme</a>
 means you can build a multi-nodal system that scales massively with 
global distribution. Additionally, object storage devices assume that 
data in geographical locations will eventually become consistent. This 
eventual consistency means you forgo <a href="http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/answer/When-should-I-use-global-file-locking-in-the-cloud">real-time file locking</a>,
 which in turn enables massive scaling with good performance. However, 
it also means data access may collide, essentially creating multiple 
versions of the data. This issue is sometimes experienced in 
applications like Dropbox when multiple copies of files get created 
because of synchronization conflicts with another user.</p>
 
<p><b>Self-healing with high data reliability.</b> Data protection is 
controlled by having multiple copies of data across global systems, and 
erasure coding improves data reliability and durability beyond the 
individual error rate of the devices themselves. Using these 
technologies enables companies like Amazon to guarantee up to 11 9s (or a
 99.999999999% level) of reliability. If a node fails or an error is 
detected, the failed data automatically rebuilds across other available 
nodes.</p>
 
<p><b>Low-cost bulk storage.</b> Inherently, object storage 
architecture tends toward an overall lower storage cost, primarily 
through using commodity hyper-scale computers and simpler metadata 
management requirements. Generally, maintaining a high-performance 
metadata system costs more to implement; an example is a scale-out NAS 
device where <a href="http://searchsolidstatestorage.techtarget.com/opinion/The-evolution-of-flash-based-storage-arrays">more flash-based storage</a>
 and higher speed inter-nodal network infrastructure is needed to 
guarantee a consistent quality of service. While some object storage 
devices employ flash to boost performance, in general, these devices 
work well without flash-based storage.</p>
 
<p>Vendors of object storage products include: Caringo, Cloudian, EMC 
Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), IBM Cleversafe and Scality (Scality claims 
both scale-out NAS and object).</p>

<section class="section main-article-chapter" data-menu-title="Recommendations">
 
<h4 class="section-title"><i class="icon" data-icon="1"></i>Recommendations</h4>
 
<p>The features of <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/answer/Object-storage-vs-NAS-Which-should-you-choose" target="_self">scale-out NAS and object storage</a>
 devices overlap more and more. For example, object storage devices are 
adding multiple interface-access methods such as file and block. They 
are also adding features such as versioning and storage analytics.</p>


 <p>Scale-out NAS products are rapidly changing as well. Vendors are 
modernizing their products with flash-first architectures running on the
 same commodity servers that object storage systems operate, for 
example, and new metadata techniques enable scalability orders of 
magnitude larger than previous clustered file systems. NAS systems are 
also adding various object storage protocols and APIs in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z2kcy19k.aspx" target="_blank">conjunction</a> with their single namespace file systems.</p>
 
<p>As these two storage architectures reach feature equivalence, it is 
leading vendors of both types of systems to stake claims for the same 
unstructured data workloads, causing confusion as to which type of 
storage product to choose. The eventual winners will be those vendors 
that can service the widest variety of unstructured workloads at a total
 cost of ownership lower than competitive offerings.</p>
 
<p>I highly recommend that you thoroughly research the numerous 
alternatives available and, if possible, validate vendor claims through 
on-premises proof-of-concept testing before committing to one technology
 approach over the other. The following are general recommendations for 
which architectural approach would best fit your environment:</p>
 
<p><b>Lead with scale-out NAS if:</b></p>
 <ul class=" default-list"> 
  <li>You have many applications that require POSIX-compliant shared access</li> 
  <li>You have a requirement for mixed workloads of small and large files</li> 
  <li>You require a more consistent quality of service</li> 
  <li>Data consistency for your critical applications is paramount</li> 
 </ul>
 
<p><b>Lead with object storage if:</b></p>
 <ul class=" default-list"> 
  <li>Most of your applications have been written to work natively with the object storage protocol/API</li> 
  <li>You require a global distribution of the data (multiple copies in multiple geographies)</li> 
  <li>You need to sca<b>l</b>e to billions or even trillions of objects inside one cluster domain</li> 
  <li>Cost per GB is a higher consideration than performance (e.g., for archive and backup use cases)</li> 
 </ul>
 
<p>As the onslaught of unstructured data continues, it is comforting to
 know innovation is still alive and well, and there are numerous 
scale-out-capable storage products to choose from. It remains to be seen
 whether file-based or object-based architectures will eventually 
prevail, however.</p>
