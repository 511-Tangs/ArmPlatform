  <h3>Turn any hard drive into networked storage with Raspberry Pi 
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-as-cheap-nas-solution/">(Source 
Origin)</a></h3>

   <p>A NAS solution can cost several hundred dollars. If you have an unused Raspberry 
Pi and a few hard drives lying around, you can make one yourself without spending a 
dime.</p>

<P>Networked hard drives are super convenient. You can access files no matter what 
computer you're on -- and even remotely.</p>

<p>But they're expensive. Unless you use the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you happen to have a few of hard drives laying around you can put them to good use 
with a Raspberry Pi by creating your own, <em>very cheap</em> NAS setup. My current 
setup is two 4TB hard drives and one 128GB hard drive, connected to my network and 
accessible from anywhere using the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p> Here's how.</p>

<h4>What you will need </h4>

<p> For starters, you need an external storage drive, such as an HDD, SSD or a flash 
drive.</p>
                            
                  
<p> You also need a Raspberry Pi. Models 1 and 2 work just fine for this application but 
you will get a little better support from the Raspberry Pi 3. With the Pi 3, you're 
still limited to USB 2.0 and 100Mbps via Ethernet. However, I was able to power one 
external HDD with a Pi 3, while the Pi 2 Model B could not supply enough power to the 
same HDD.</p>

<p> In my Raspberry Pi NAS, I currently have one powered 4TB HDD, one non-powered 4TB 
HDD and a 128GB flash drive mounted without issue. To use a Pi 1 or 2 with this, you may 
want to consider using a powered USB hub for your external drives or using a HDD that 
requires external power.</p>

<p> Additionally, you need a microSD card -- 8GB is recommended -- and the 
OpenMediaVault OS image, which you can 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmediavault/files/Raspberry%20Pi%20images/" 
target="_blank">download here</a>.</p>

<h4>Installing the OS </h4>

<p> To install the operating system, we will use the same 
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/install-raspbian-on-a-raspberry-pi-without-noobs/" 
target="_b">>method used for installing any OS without NOOBS</a>. In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Format the SD card to FAT32 using 
      <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/" target="_blank">SD 
      Formatter</a>.</li>	
  <li>Download the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmediavault/files/Raspberry%20Pi%20images/" target="_blank">image file</a> from Sourceforge.</li>	
  <li>Extract it using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7zip</a> on 
      Windows or <a  target="_blank" 
      href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12">The 
      Unarchiver</a> on Mac.</li>	
  <li>Write the extracted image to the SD card using 
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/" target="_blank">Win32 
      Disk Imager</a> on Windows or <a target="_blank" 
      href="http://www.tweaking4all.com/news/applepi-baker-v1-9-4-update-macos-sierra-beta-2/">ApplePi-Baker</a> on Mac.</li>
</ul>

<p> More detailed installation instructions 
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/install-raspbian-on-a-raspberry-pi-without-noobs/" 
target="_blank">can be found here</a> for both Windows and Mac. Just substitute the 
Raspbian image with OpenMediaVault.</p>

<h4>Setup </h4>

<p> After the image has been written to the SD card, connect peripherals to the Raspberry
    Pi. For the first boot, you need a keyboard, monitor and a local network connection 
    via Ethernet. Next, connect power to the Raspberry Pi and let it complete the initial
    boot process.</p>

<p> Once that is finished, use the default web interface credentials to sign in. (By 
default, the username is <strong>admin</strong> and the password is 
<strong>openmediavault</strong>.) This will provide you with the IP address of the 
Raspberry Pi. After you have that, you will no longer need a keyboard and monitor 
connected to the Pi.</p>

<p> Connect your storage drives to the Raspberry Pi and open a web browser on a computer 
on the same network. Enter the IP address into the address bar of the browser and press 
return. Enter the same login credentials again (<strong>admin</strong> for the username 
and <strong>openmediavault</strong> for the password) and you will be taken to the web 
interface for your installation of OpenMediaVault.</p>

<h4>Mounting the disks </h4>

<img style="display: block;" src="https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/WDUTn8LW8ZXROwYVr39i5tFiQ7M=/670x503/2016/08/23/90868c1d-f0b2-4c2d-b8d1-9da2503b0816/raspberry-pi-nas-openmediavault.jpg">Photo by  Screenshot by Taylor Martin/CNET

<p> The first thing you will want to do to get your NAS online is to mount your external 
drives. Click <strong>File Systems</strong> in the navigation menu to the left under 
<strong>Storage</strong>.</p>

<p> Locate your storage drives, which will be listed under the  <strong>Device</strong> 
column as something like <strong>/dev/sda1</strong> or <strong>/dev/sdc2</strong>. Click 
one drive to select it and click <strong>Mount</strong>. After a few seconds have passed,
 click <strong>Apply</strong> in the upper right corner to confirm the action.</p>

<p> Repeat this step to mount any additional drives.</p>

<h4>Creating a shared folder </h4>

<img style="display: block;" src="https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/rHDl1H6Ke5_0ID1_7LcuM5GNv_E=/2016/08/23/ac0a9318-c0f8-4fef-9207-ad001d388af7/openmediavault-raspberry-pi-shared-folders.png">Photo by  Screenshot by Taylor Martin/CNET
                                       
<p> Next, you will need to create a shared folder so that the drives can be accessed by 
other devices on the network. To do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Shared Folders</strong> in the navigation pane under <strong>Access 
      Rights Management</strong>.</li>	
  <li>Click <strong>Add</strong> and give the folder a name.</li>	
  <li>Select one of the storage drives in the dropdown menu to the right of 
      <strong>Volume</strong>.</li>	
  <li>Specify a path (if you want it to be different from the name).</li>	
  <li>Click save.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enabling SMB/CFIS </h4>

<img style="display: block;" src="https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/RnXFiHVTCcTSpG3zTMnhkRyybN4=/0x0:1019x692/2016/08/23/274a7b84-e6c9-4234-9cfa-27747f2b1988/openmediavault-smb-raspberry-pi.png">Photo by Screenshot by Taylor Martin/CNET
                                

<p> Finally, to access these folders and drives from an external computer on the 
network, you need to enable SMB/CFIS.</p>

<p> Click <strong>SMB/CFIS</strong> under <strong>Services</strong> in the left 
navigation pane and click the toggle button beside <strong>Enable</strong>. Click 
<strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Apply</strong> to confirm the changes.</p>

<p> Next, click on the <strong>Shares</strong> tab near the top of the window. Click 
<strong>Add</strong>, select one of the folders you created in the dropdown menu beside 
<strong>Shared folder</strong> and click <strong>Save</strong>. Repeat this step for 
shared folders you created.</p>

<h4>Accessing the drives over your network </h4>

<p> Now that your NAS is up and running, you need to map those drives from another 
computer to see them. This process is different for Windows and Mac, but should only 
take a few seconds.</p>

<h4>Windows </h4>

<img style="display: block;" src="https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/Z5ntz0C2LaXT7oDtPN4o38nMfAM=/2016/08/23/9470edd8-fbb6-4f59-9d94-9756a88c12d1/raspberry-pi-map-network-folder-windows.png">Photo by Screenshot by Taylor Martin/CNET
                                      
<p> To access a networked drive on Windows, open <strong>File Explorer</strong> and 
click <strong>This PC</strong>. Select the <strong>Computer tab</strong> and click 
<strong>Map network drive</strong>.</p>

<p> In the dropdown menu beside <strong>Drive</strong> choose an unused drive letter. In 
the <strong>Folder</strong> field, input the path to the network drive. By default, it 
should look something like <strong>\\RASPBERRYPI\[folder name]</strong>. (For instance, 
one of my folders is HDD, so the folder path is <strong>\\RASPBERRYPI\HDD</strong>). 
Click <strong>Finish</strong> and enter the login credentials. By default, the username 
is <strong>pi</strong> and the password is <strong>raspberry</strong>. If you change or 
forgot the login for the user, you can reset it or create a new user and password in the 
web interface under <strong>User</strong> in <strong>Access Rights Management</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Mac </h4>

<img style="display: block;" src="https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/jzKErBD-Q9u9DDxb-aSGLnL9VIY=/2016/08/23/f77f4cc1-1f31-49c1-9cf3-569fffd30cdb/mount-network-drive-mac-raspberry-pi.png">

<p> To open a networked folder in OS X, open <strong>Finder</strong> and press 
<strong>Command + K</strong>. In the window that appears, type 
<strong>smb://raspberrypi</strong> or <strong>smb://[IP address]</strong> and click 
<strong>Connect</strong>. In the next window, highlight the volumes you want to mount 
and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
                            

<p> You should now be able to see and access those drives within Finder or File Explorer 
and move files on or off the networked drives.</p>

<p> There are tons of settings to tweak inside OpenMediaVault, including the ability to 
reboot the NAS remotely, setting the date and time, power management, a plugin manager 
and much, much more. But if all you need is a network storage solution, you'll never 
need to dig any deeper.</p>
