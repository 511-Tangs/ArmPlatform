<p>NoSQL databases are known for their flexibility and 
performance, but no single type of NoSQL database is right for all use 
cases. This article discusses two types of NoSQL databases, <em>key-value</em> databases and <em>document</em> databases, and describes how to decide between the two when choosing a database.</p>

<h4>Simplicity: Key-Value Databases</h4>

<p>Key-value databases and document databases are quite similar. 
Key-value databases are the simplest of the NoSQL databases: The basic 
data structure is a dictionary or map. You can store a value, such as an
 integer, string, a JSON structure, or an array, along with a key used 
to reference that value. For example, a simple key-value database might 
have a value such as <tt>"Douglas Adams"</tt>. This value is then assigned an ID, such as <tt>cust1237</tt>.</p>

<p>Using a JSON structure adds complexity to the database. For example, 
the database could store a full mailing address in addition to a 
person's name. In the previous example, key <tt>cust1237</tt> could point to the following information:</p>

<pre>{name: "Douglas Adams",
 street: "782 Southwest St.",
 city: "Austin",
 state:  "TX"}</pre>

<p>Key management is vital to smooth operations in a key-value database.
 Because key-value databases have no SQL-style query language to 
describe which values to fetch, keys are used to reference data. Some 
key-value databases compensate for the lack of a query language by 
incorporating search capabilities. Instead of searching by key, users 
can search values for particular patterns; for example, all values with a
 certain string in the name, such as <tt>"Douglas"</tt>. However, freeform search is not available in all key-value databases.</p>

<p><a onclick="newwindow(this)" href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>, <a onclick="newwindow(this)" href="http://basho.com/">Riak</a>, and <a onclick="newwindow(this)" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/nosqldb/overview/key-value-497224.html">Oracle NoSQL</a> database are examples of key-value databases.</p>

<h4>Flexibility: Document Databases</h4>

<p>Document databases such as <a onclick="newwindow(this)" href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and <a onclick="newwindow(this)" href="http://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>
 extend the concept of the key-value database. In fact, document 
databases maintain sets of key-value pairs within a document. The JSON 
example shown earlier is also a document. The term <em>document</em> in NoSQL databases refers to a set of key-value pairs, typically represented in JSON, XML, or a binary form of JSON.</p>

<h4>Feature Comparison</h4>

<p>If a document database is essentially a key-value database with more 
features, shouldn't you choose the option with more features and be done
 with it? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>Document databases organize documents into groups called <em>collections</em>,
 which are analogous to the tables in relational databases. By contrast,
 key-value databases store all key-value pairs together in a single 
namespace, which is analogous to a relational schema.</p>

<p>Key-value pairs of similar types, such as IDs and names, are stored 
with dissimilar value pairs, such as IDs and customer orders. This 
sounds like a potential problem, but whether it is depends on the search
 capabilities of the key-value database. When searching using freeform 
text to find the ID associated with a given name, you can search across 
all value types--not just names. However, unless search queries are 
properly crafted, this approach could end up being less efficient than 
using a document database.</p>

<p>Document database collections allow developers to apply a high level 
of organization to their databases. For example, a document database for
 an e-commerce site might include collections for customers, orders, and
 products:</p>

<ul>
	<li> <em>Customers</em> would include fields such as name, shipping address, and billing address.</li>
	<li> <em>Orders</em> would include fields such as product and shipping address data.</li>
	<li> <em>Products</em> would include fields such as department and price data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Document databases can also provide better performance when working 
with complex data sets. Separating collection entities by type, such as 
orders and customer profiles, can help with performance. Similarly, 
large collections, such as a collection of products, can be partitioned 
to improve query performance. Partitioning splits collections over 
multiple servers, allocating a subset of work to each server.</p>

<p>Document databases also support indexing, which can improve query 
performance by using filter criteria, such as searching for all orders 
placed in the last 10 days. However, it's often best to limit the use of
 indexes, confining them to fields that are commonly used in filtering 
query results. Having too many indexes can slow write operations. In the
 end, using indexes is a tradeoff. You may get faster query responses at
 the expense of slower write operations, plus the cost of additional 
space to store index data.</p>

<h4>Making Your Choice</h4>

<p>The choice between key-value and document databases comes down to 
your data and application needs. If you usually retrieve data by key or 
ID value and don't need to support complex queries, a key-value database
 is a good option. If you don't need search capabilities beyond key 
lookup, a key-value database that supports searching may be sufficient. 
If you have different types of entities and need complex querying, 
choose a document database.</p>

<p>Both key-value and document databases are sound choices for many 
database applications. If query patterns and data structures are fairly 
simple, key-value databases are a good choice. As the complexity of 
queries and entities increase, document databases become a better 
option.</p>
