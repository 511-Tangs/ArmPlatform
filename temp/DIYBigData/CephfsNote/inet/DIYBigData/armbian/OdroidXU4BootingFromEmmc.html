<p>Ok, So I'm pretty sure I've gotten the problem solved with my EMMC module on my XU4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will need 3 things to make this a success.</p>

<OL>
  <LI> UART Module available from hardkernel or ameridroid (USA), or you 
       can just buy an ftdi usb to uart cable but make sure you buy the 1.8V 
       version so you don't over-voltage the console port</p>
  <LI> MicroSD card flashed with the latest version of Armbian I used 5.25</p>
  <LI> EMMC module for the XU4 ALSO flashed with the lastest Armbian
       version.</p>
</OL>

<OL>
  <LI> Install BOTH the microsd and the emmc module into the XU4
  <LI> Hook up the uart module to another computer and open up putty or 
       hyperterminal or whatever you prefer, so when you power up your XU4 you 
       can see the boot process (baud rate is 115200)
  <LI> Switch the Boot selector switch to microSD card.
  <LI> Apply power to XU4
  <LI> After you see text scrolling hit enter twice to stop UBOOT
  <LI> If done correctly you should be greeted with a 'Exynos5422 #' prompt
  <LI> Run this command "run copy_uboot_sd2emmc"
  <LI> Below is a printout of a successful copy of armbians uboot to the
       special-hidden uboot partition on the EMMC module
</OL>

</pre>

<p>if you receive a eMMC OPEN Failed.!! message you didn't select the microSD as the boot</p>

<p>Final step is to remove power, remove the microSD card and move the boot selector switch to the EMMC module.</p>

<p>Enjoy your blazing fast EMMC</p>
