<P>When compared to more traditional relational databases, the NoSQL platform is 
remarkably scalable and offers much better throughput performance over a network. Both 
of these are important aspects for cloud storage systems that distribute data over a 
wide physical area and may not know where the next access to a database is coming from. 
</p>

<p>Relational databases were never designed to work with large volumes of data that may 
be unstructured or feature a changing structure. All records in a relational database 
have to follow a certain structure. NoSQL design is far more flexible, which might 
explain why many developers say the name means "Not Only SQL."</p>

<p>Support for scale-out architecture over a wide area of geographical distribution has 
allowed developers to bid farewell to expensive large monolithic designs. This is 
particularly attractive to cloud storage providers, as is added support for quick schema 
iteration. If an organization has to frequently push new code into a database without 
fundamentally altering the underlying database, then this provides a solution as well.
</p>

<h3>NoSQL Data Storage Techniques</h3>

<p>Key-value store solutions provide the building blocks for the NoSQL system. 
Associative arrays, which are better known as hashes in common parlance, contain a 
series of records. In a relational database (RDB), these records each have the same 
fields. NoSQL doesn't make such requirements, since key-value stores work so drastically 
differently from these systems. RDB paradigms require all data fields to exist within 
documented data types. Key-value store hashes treat each piece of data as a single 
opaque collection. It could have different fields within any record, or it could be 
comparatively empty. The value specification is agnostic to this, but instead merely 
provides a pointer by which a particular data set could be found.</p>

<p>Most implementations provide a cloud storage developer with a generic key-value 
structure. Each record receives its own set of key-value pairs. Keys can have multiple 
components structured in an ordered list. Major keys identify the entity. Anything after 
this section is called a minor key, and cloud developers may use them as they see fit. 
What makes this <b>major-minor key pairing </b>so appealing to cloud developers is that 
it maps well to directory path specifications in file systems. Cloud developers can 
organize data into what are essentially directories.</p>

<p>Consider a major key entitled majorKey, which would sit at the top of 
specification:</p>

<p><em>\majorKey</em></p>

<p>It could feature multiple minor keys underneath it:</p>

<p><em>\majorKey\minorKey1</em></p>

<p><em>\majorKey\minorKey1\minorKey2</em></p>

<p><em>\majorKey\minorKey1\minorKey3</em></p>

<p>Notice that this resembles climbing a classic DOS directory tree. Developers who work 
with the NT platform might also recognize it as being similar to the way keys are stored 
in the Windows Registry. In this manner, a cloud storage system can neatly store and 
then recall data types without knowing anything more about their specifications than a 
mere label. Each of these keys point to a value, which is just a single byte-string of 
any arbitrary length. There's no specific rule that said byte-string must follow. </p>

<h3>Document-Orientation in the Cloud</h3>

<p>Since NoSQL is so loose with how it stores data, it's actually easy to make the 
values entire documents. Some developers refer to this as creating semi-structured data. 
Document stores orient themselves toward storing document code inside of the byte-string 
of a key-value pair. This data could be in XML, JSON or any other format that uses 
abstracted plain text. In theory, it's actually possible to use a file format like RTF 
as well. Mapping objects into a database in this method is remarkably easy, as it 
<b>eliminates the need for any sort of object-relational mapping</b>.</p>

<p>This is precisely why document-orientation is so popular when developing Web
 applications for cloud solutions. These applications are constantly changing in place 
and it's important to consider performance in these scenarios. On top of mapping each 
document value to a separate key, these databases offer an API that lets users retrieve 
documents based around metadata. This at least in theory reduces the amount of time that
 any given user searches the database. Reducing the total number of searches for 
documents can reduce the amount of data that has to pass through a network at any given 
time.</p>

<p>Since the fields present in a document don't exist as any pre-existing concept, it 
would be difficult to search the internal structure as a table, which makes this feature 
important. That being said, it also means that no additional work is ever needed to pick 
up any related data, since everything is fed to the client as one single object. This 
also helps to eliminate problems related to mapping function definitions to database 
tables, which is sometimes compared to electrical impedance matching. </p>

<h3>Challenges NoSQL Techniques Pose</h3>

<p>No system is perfect, and cloud storage companies that transition to NoSQL database 
techniques can experience some unique challenges. NoSQL systems are notably prone to 
lost writes, which makes them suffer from the same issues that NTFS and HFS+ fall victim 
to. Developers have come up with a novel solution to this problem.</p>

<p><b>Write-ahead logging</b> has existed as a concept for use in local file systems for 
some time, but computer scientists usually restrict the conversation about WAL 
techniques to databases specifically. Nevertheless, it may be helpful to think of WAL 
subroutines as a form of journaling for NoSQL databases. All writes to the database are 
initially written to a log section. Undo information is included, as is redo, in case 
the write doesn't successfully complete. Should a routine writing to the database stall 
for whatever reason, the database can recover consistency by checking the data shared 
in this log much like a file system journal.</p>

<p>Distributed transaction processing activities across multiple NoSQL databases present 
some major challenges too. Data consistency is a major issue here. Data consistency 
values are inversely proportional to the number of NoSQL databases within a DTP 
environment. It should be noted, however, that even relational databases aren't capable 
of running sophisticated consistency checks across a series of multiple databases.</p>

<p>Skewed data access patterns can lead to major performance problems across databases 
accessed by multiple network hosts. Keep in mind that all transactions, distributed or 
not, should adhere to all four of the ACID properties. Technically NoSQL technology is 
built around the concept of eventual consistency, but programmers seldom actually use 
this in real world scenarios. If there were any sort of network transmission error, 
then this could slow down a database. Unanticipated load spikes can also be a major 
issue. Consider a cloud storage system accessible by several different organizations, 
who all have equal read and write privileges as they're all sharing data with one 
another in order to work on joint projects. Balancer algorithms can now provide several 
features that help to solve this issue:</p>

<h4>Distributed operations</h4>

<p>This function can operate on a per-node basis. Even when only a portion of a cloud 
network's nodes is active this function can switch on since it doesn't actually require 
a central origin point to work. </p>

<a href="http://www.stratoscale.com/blog/cloud/cloud-101-geo-fencing/" 
target="_blank">here</a>.</div></div>

<p></p>

<h4>Abstraction layers</h4>

<p>Some algorithms allow developers to map new load balancing routines by passing a set 
of message and action types along with appropriate triggers for them. Since a balancer 
works independently from any data values, it only ever needs a set of actions like 
movement and routing information. This reduces the amount of data that has to be passed 
during peak access times in a cloud network. </p>

<h4>Modular design</h4>

<p>Every balancing method uses the same sort of primitive operations. Data transfer 
operations are never actually different, which means that implementations of even the 
balancers can be scalable. </p>

<h4>Lightweight Designs</h4>

<p>Only probing and sync messages are ever utilized to server load balancing routines in 
quality solutions. This once more reduces the amount of data that has to be passed as 
well as reducing what server and client machine processors have to do when they access 
data stored in the cloud.</p>

<p>Administrators could never predict usage patterns in this sort of situation. </p>

<h3>Why NoSQL is the Choice for Cloud Developers</h3>

<p>The newer NoSQL approaches to data management present clear advantages for cloud 
developers. NoSQL data services are based around structures and architectures that are 
scalable. There's no need to construct complicate SQL query code. Developers are free 
to select a data model and then code for it. They can write applications with tools 
with which they have experience, and ultimately reduce the number of dependencies 
they're working with.</p>

<p>NoSQL is also attractive for cloud developers because it doesn't require the use of 
a black box. It's done well to overcome its challenges. Ultimately NoSQL databases have 
come quite a way in terms of handling read and write discrepancies. If databases are 
slow on the test system, then they can simply be taken care of later by tuning them. 
With its emphasis on abstraction and simplicity, it makes sense that cloud 
administrators are considering NoSQL for their database needs. While it's by no means 
perfect, the NoSQL platform does deserve serious consideration when setting up a 
database to work with cloud software.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stratoscale.com/wp-content/uploads/Storage-Management-Considerations.jpg"><img alt="Storage Management Considerations" height="300" width="384" 
src="http://www.stratoscale.com/wp-content/uploads/Storage-Management-Considerations.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Creating traditional storage appliances required a lengthy process that often took up 
to two years. Think of all the steps involved - planning, design, procurement, buying 
samples, testing, manufacturing and testing.  Not only time consuming, it was also 
expensive, since the manufacturer must keep enough spare parts for each SKU for about 
seven years.  Bad news for customers, the costs of these lengthy and expensive process 
are passed on to the customer's pocket. Due to these lengthy, expensive and complex 
processes, it was almost impossible to create storage appliances that supported more 
than three or four configurations, resulting in appliances with limited flexibility and 
diversity of supported hardware. </p>

<h4>HDDs and SSDs</h4>

<p>HDDs show little variability between a 1TB and 6TB drive, in terms of performance and 
cost.  Each storage controller can contain a number of HDDs with some variability 
in capacity.  SSDs contain nonvolatile flash memory providing much higher performance, 
capacity, density and lower power consumption. </p>

<h4>All Flash Arrays</h4>

<p> All Flash Arrays (AFAs) are storage appliances that are composed of flash memory 
only. The AFAs are usually using one type of SSDs that is usually a compromise of all 
properties. For example, stuffing 512 GB SSDs in the AFA gives low density, but cost 
effective performance. </p>

<h4>Capacity and Density</h4>

<p>SSDs offer wide range of capacity for every property. For example, capacity can vary 
from 256GB to 16TB, providing 16 times the density. SSD endurance is measured by two 
main criteria, Terabytes Written (TBW) and Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD).</p>

<p>TBW refers to the total amount of data that can be <a target="_blank" 
href="http://thessdguy.com/comparing-dwpd-to-tbw/">written into an SSD</a> before it is 
likely to fail, but this specification doesn't really specify how many years the drive 
will last. Another property that describes SSD endurance is Drives Writes Per Day 
(DWPD). This measures how much data you can add to the drive daily, on average, through 
its lifespan; if you write more it may wear out sooner. DWPD ranges from 0.1 to 10, 
hence, SSD endurance can vary up to 100 times. </p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>Before SSDs, Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) performance for HDDs was 
approximately 100-200 random read-writes. SSDs improved performance by two orders of 
magnitude with consumer grade IOPS of 50K, delivering 16 times the performance value. 
High-end SSDs deliver and three orders of magnitude with with IOPS of 800K. </p>

<h4>Price </h4>

<p>SSD prices show a wide variance, from 30 cents/GB at the low end for consumer usage 
(0.1 DWPD) and up to about $2.00/GB (10.0 TBW) for the high performance enterprise 
models. Hidden in the cost of enterprise storage, or added on, are the costs of the 
controllers, backplanes, management nodes and a number of other components. </p>

<p>All Flash Arrays, often containing low end SSDs, have also made a significant impact 
on pricing of storage appliances, and are usually priced at $7.50/GB. As prices of SSDs 
have plummeted in the past few years, more organizations have reaped the high 
performance benefits of that this technology offers. </p>

<p>AFA vendors are finding it difficult to unleash the full power of SSDs. The range of 
capabilities and costs requires customization to specific requirements. However, AFA 
vendors can only offer limited type of appliances and therefore they make the choice and 
compromises for their customers. </p>

<h4>The effect of software defined environments</h4>

<p><a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.stratoscale.com/blog/cloud/software-defined-data-storage-solutions-and-the-cloud/">Software 
Defined Storage</a> (SDS) solutions have no ties to specific hardware configurations or 
hardware models or manufacturers, allowing companies to leverage existing hardware 
without any limitations. For example, companies can mix higher-cost, high performance 
solutions for critical applications and use lower cost storage for 'cold data' that is 
rarely accessed. </p>

href="http://www.stratoscale.com/blog/compute/implications-of-running-your-storage-using-a-vm-vs-embedded/">using 
virtual machines</a> instead of distributed embedded SDS.</div></div>

<p></p>

<p>SDS provides ultimate flexibility as organizations can choose cost-effective 
solutions with the type of hardware that is best suited for their applications, without 
the limitation of of the trade-offs made by an AFA vendor.  Another advantage is being 
able to use brand new hardware. Due to the lengthy cycle required to develop AFAs 
you will always be utilizing older models.</p>

<p>The paradigm shift from storage appliances into <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.stratoscale.com/blog/cloud/private-clouds-turning-software-defined-models-into-a-reality/"><strong>Software 
Defined Storage (SDS)</strong></a> is gaining more and more traction, particularly, in 
web scale distributed systems. Virtual appliances (i.e. storage controller function 
packaged as VM) are perceived as a type of SDS. Storage Virtual Appliance would usually 
be deployed to consume server local storage devices and collaborate with other virtual 
appliance instances to support data resiliency and availability function. &nbsp;It is 
also expected to provide connectivity to volumes from each node. This creates fairly 
intensive traffic between the Virtual Storage Appliances. This traffic facilitates 
striping, mirroring or other sorts of data resiliency like erasure coding. </p>

<p>Data efficiency like data de-duplication, thin provisioning and support of data 
services would further increase the network traffic. In addition, every guest VM will 
have to communicate with the Storage Virtual Appliances to access its data. In general, 
this SDS implementation of virtual appliances typically increases the load on the 
hypervisors and requires careful attention to performance when deploying it. SRIOV and 
other optimizations are not available for all devices and configurations. Hence, it is 
likely to get fairly noticeable performance hits as well as increased resource 
consumption when deploying SDS as virtual appliances. 

<P> The alternative would be using distributed embedded SDS. In this case, all storage 
services are running natively on the host OS or packaged as 
<a href="http://www.stratoscale.com/blog/devops/containers-and-microservices-achieving-immutability/" 
target="_blank">containers</a>.  In such an environment they run as efficiently as the 
hardware allows for. They can use any sort of DMA, RDMA, NVMe or other efficient device 
access protocols to speed up performance and reduce CPU consumption.  This ensures that 
guest VMs are getting ultimately the best performance possible. In many cases, this 
would be even more efficient than the performance a dedicated storage appliance can 
provide to a VM; as with smart management you can move the VM to run in a server where 
it can access its data from a local device rather than through the network. This kind 
of deployment is likely to become more prevalent to comply with requirements for massive 
scale and high performance.</p>

What are considerations choosing one type of database according to the given problem?

<P>For each of these classifications of databases, the actual implementations 
will vary from vendor to vendor with some offering different scheme and 
querying capabilities as well as other fields.  There is a lot of 
cross over between the different types and generally speaking, they're 
all build to be distributed and scaled horizontally.  This will give you a general overview of the differences:  

<P><b>Key-Value</b>
 stores store keys value pairs, generally in buckets, exactly like a 
hash table data structure...each key must be unique.  They are 
extremely fast for writing, and extremely fast for reading and 
updating...if you have the key.  They are slow on multiple updates 
and if you have to query the entire store.   You see Key-value 
stores used a lot as caching stores because of their fast reads. (see: 
Redis, Riak, memcached, Azure's tablestore, etc)  

<P><b>Column stores</b> seem to store data in related rows, but they actually serialize the data into columns.   With a row based database you would have: 

<P>ID,firstname, lastname, websitename 

<PRE>
1:bart, loews, quora 
2:jim, finnegan, beginagain 
3:don, quixote, windmill 
</PRE>

The column store stores columns together, like this: 

<PRE>
1:bart,2:jim,3:don 
1:loews,2:finnegan,3:quixote 
1:quora,2:beginagain,3:windmill
</PRE>

<P>This allows for much faster querying and processing of data while storing data that's 
somewhat related (druid boasts billions of records per second).  <br>These are used 
in a lot of high powered big-data analysis where speed is critical. (Cassandra, Google's 
BigTable, Druid)

<P><b>Document Stores </b>store data in "documents", typically XML or JSON documents. 
They're typically schemaless, so each document can contain any data that you want them 
to have and you can change it on the fly.  Documents 
contain key value pairs, which can be any sort of value, array, or even 
another document.  For example:

<PRE>
{
FirstName: "Bart",
LastName: "Loews",
Children: [ {
                   
          FirstName:"Tadd",
          Age: 4},
          {
                     
           FirstName:"Todd",
           Age:4}
          ],
Age: 35,
Address:{
      number:1234,
      street: "Fake road",
      City: "Fake City",
      state: "VA",
      Country: "USA"
        }
}
</PRE>

<P>Document stores allow you to play with your data and store it however you see fit. 
They have fast writing, good query times based on indexing, but the main advantage is 
the schema flexibility and nestibility.

<p>You could 
see these being used for pretty much any thing, some vendors will let 
you perform relational joins between documents, but generally, for the 
best flexibility you'll have to build in any join logic into your 
application.

<p>Some examples include: MongoDB, OrientDB, CouchDB, Azure's DocumentDB, AWS DynamoDB, RethinkDB.

<P><b>Graph Stores </b>focus
 on relationships.  The best way to picture a graph store is like a
 mathematical graph where you have edges and vertices.  With a 
graph store data is stored as Nodes and Relationships.  A Node is 
basically a noun, a person, place, thing, entity, etc.  A 
relationship is a one or two way connection between two nodes.  A 
node could be people and a relationship could be a two way friendship. 
You could have two nodes, a link to a website, and a user, and the 
relationship could be a one way "like" from the user to the website.

<P>You
 can usually apply metadata documents to nodes and relationships, as 
well as labels. You can label a node as a user or a website or a pet or 
whatever. You can add data like name, age, gender to user nodes, it's 
schemaless and very flexible.

<P>Graph stores excel at determining 
relationships between nodes and finding patterns.  For example, you
 can use a graph store to determine friends of friends or friends of 
friends of friends or friends of friends to the nth degree.  You 
could figure out people you're not friends with, you can find people who
 are friends of friends who like the same things you do, you can find 
people who have worked with friends of friends who like the same things 
you do who don't have pets.  

<P>They handle these crazy queries quickly.

<P>I'm unaware of who uses them, but they'd be great for social networking and for retail marketing purposes.

<P>Examples of this include: neo4j and orientDB.



<P><a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Kyle-Olson-27" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough">Kyle Olson</a>

<P>1)
 Column-Oriented databases are most similar to traditional row based 
databases since both are usually relational. Columnar databases simply 
store data in columns instead of rows, thus making searching on each 
column much faster. However inserts and updates are generally slower in 
column databases. 

<P>In practice, columnar databases often store 
data in column families. In this case you would probably not store the 
street, city, zip in completely separate columns, but instead in a 
column family where they are stored together. The differences between 
row based and column based databases start to blur even more in this 
scenario.

<P>2) Key-Value and Document databases are very similar to
 each other. The only real difference is document databases store their 
values in a more structured way. A key-value database may simply store 
blobs of data for each key with little knowledge of what is in each 
blob. 

<P>A document database is still basically a key-value store, 
but it knows information about the format of each value. They may be 
XML, JSON, RDF, etc. This allows the database to more easily query 
information found in each document.

<P>3) Graph databases are 
basically built upon the Entity - Attribute - Value model. It is a very 
flexible way to describe how data relates to other data. A popular graph
 database, Neo4j, renames the terminology to Node - Relationship - 
Property. 

<P>Nodes store data about each entity in the database, 
Relationships describe a relationship between nodes, and a Property is 
simply the node on the opposite end of the relationship. Whereas a 
traditional database stores a description of each possible relationship 
in foreign key fields or junction tables, graph databases allow for 
virtually any relationship to be defined on the fly.

<P>------

<P>Column
 store databases are generally used when reporting is more important 
than data modification. Columnar databases are often an order of 
magnitude faster than row based databases for common reporting usage. 
They are usually much slower for write operations, so they tend to be 
used in OLAP while row based is used in OLTP situations. Otherwise 
columnar databases are very similar to traditional databases.

<P>Key-Value
 databases are by far the simplest to implement, since they are little 
more than a large hash table. They are effortlessly partition-able so 
they can store a large amount of unstructured data with ease. If you 
just need to store fairly static data and don't have to do much 
processing on it, a simple key-value database could be the way to go.

<P>Document
 databases give in my opinion all of the benefits of key-value stores 
but also allow the data to be more easily processed. Because data is 
stored in a flexible schema, you can still perform queries such as 
searching by city or last name. This schema is not managed like in a 
traditional database, unless the application logic enforces a schema, so
 the data is more likely to be "dirtier" than a traditional RDBMS. But 
you get the freedom to create new fields on the fly without modifying a 
database schema.

<P>Graph databases are used to solve a problem that
 can be very difficult to solve with relational databases: complex 
mappings between data. A database schema generally needs well defined 
relationships between tables, and complex many-to-many relationships 
could require a large number of junction tables which are complicated 
and may require expensive joins. Graph databases can store complex and 
fluid relationships with ease. The trade-off is that querying or 
updating large amounts of data can be very slow, since nodes of similar 
nodes that aren't necessarily related are usually not stored close 
together. It is also easy for applications to define similar 
relationships in very different ways, making it harder to organize data 
consistently.

<p><i>Good
 answers: but all of them are fundamentally misleading in one aspect: 
confusing a column store with a column-oriented store (In fact the 
terminology "column-oriented store" itself is so wrong). I tried to 
clear the air here. </i><a data-tooltip="attached" href="http://bytecontinnum.com/column-stores-column-oriented-databases/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" data-qt-tooltip="bytecontinnum.com">Terminology confusion: Column Stores and Column oriented databases</a>. (Do read the reference sections)</p>

<p><b>TL;DR </b>-
 The feature, "column families" introduced in the data stores like 
Cassandra and HBASE lead to this confusion and the whole new terminology
 "column-oriented store". While "Column stores" are in existence forever
 now and it is nothing but relational stores which stores data 
column-wise physically to optimise aggregate queries.</p>

<p><b>Verdict: "</b>Column

GreenPlum, Vertica and Teradata Aster are good examples which support an
 optional storage engine to create a table as a column store. 
"Column-oriented store" is a poor terminology. In fact datastax calls 
cassandra as a distributed row-store.</p>

 value is stored in the database in form on a two value tuple. One is 
the identifier(key) and other is the actual data(Value), and hence it is
 called as Key Value Store.

<p>I can by typically used when you have application where you require hashing. For example. BookId(Key) &amp; Book Details(value).

<p>So if you know key value you dont need to traverse through whole database to get the required info.

<P><b>Column-Oriented</b>

<P>The data stored in this is completely different, it stores data in Columns.

<p>This
 approach lends itself well to aggregate queries and analytics  
scenarios where you might run range queries over a specific field. 
Roughly,in simple terms for report generation based on huge data.

<P><b>Documnet-Oriented </b>

<P>The
 data is stored again key value pair, where the key is a String and the 
data is stored a document in memory. The data is identified by the 
string.

<p>It is used whn you want to store large files such as Videos, music etc.

<P><b>Graph Database</b>

<P> It
 uses the graph theory to optimise the search and the data is connected 
like a graph(graph used in data structure). It is used when you have to 
process a load of data which are interconnected with different nodes. 
Facebook uses this feature in its new feature of Graph Search.

<P>Please correct me if I am wrong.

<p>There are a number of NoSQL databases, the major classifications are as given below:</p>

<p>a.)
 Document Based Databases: The smallest unit of storage for these 
databases is a document. MongoDB is a major commercial implementation of
 this type of databases.</p>

<p>b.) Key Value Pair: These databases store data in form of Key value pairs. A major example of these is Cassandra.</p>

<p>c.)
 Graphical Databases: These databases stores data in the form of nodes, 
edges and properties to store data. An example of this type is neo4j.</p>

<p>Hope this answers your question.</p>
