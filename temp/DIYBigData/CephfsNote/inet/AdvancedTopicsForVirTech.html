         <LI> UML Root Filesystem: <b>ResizeRootFS</b> in /src3/UML
         <LI> KVM Root Filesystem: <b>start-Gparted-6-resizing</b> in /src4/KVM/bin
      </UL>

      <P> The significance: If our root filesystem templates are tested throughly, and 
          we feel that they are stable and reliable.  We can always take any of them 
          to clone our VMs safely and quickly.  But, very often, we need more storage 
          space for additional special purpose software packages.

  <LI> COW: Copy On Write, also known as Overlay Technique 

      <P> Not suitable for VMs in a high availability cluster. It's OK for VMs in
          high performance cluster.

      <P> Also recall the failure of VM booting after software upgrading of the 
          template Root Filesystem after creation of our overlay image.
  <LI> <b>qemu-system-arm</b>

       <P> Using <b>qemu-system-arm</b>, we may run raspberry pi2 virtual machine 
       in our x86_64 based physical hosts.  (We need to have 4 or more cores in 
       our motherboard to boot it successfully.) 

       <P> <b>Note: (06/02/2016)</b> Still, I can't figure out why we can boot 
         Rpi2 linux 3.18, (and Rpi2 linux 4.1, tested recently), but not Rpi2 linux 
         4.4.

       <P> This is really significant achievement.  I have created a cross-compilation 
         VM for developing software for arm based machines in x86_64 host.  We all 
         know a decent x86_64 based machine, (say, with 6 or more cores), has better 
         software development environment, faster compilation speed, etc.  If we need 
         to test the software we generated immediately, this is the solution I am 
         aiming at.
  <LI> <b>vdev</b>

       <P> We have encountered all the difficulties imposed on us by <b>Red-Hat</b>,
           to name a couple of it: shameless <b>systemd</b> pollution, unpredictable 
           ethercard renaming, etc.  In the near future, we will be based our linux 
           systems on the ones distributed by <b>devuan</b>.  At least, we can have 
           a systemd-free system.  Our next goal is freeing ourselves from the udev
           and dbus hazardous software traps.

       <P> Our achievement:  We successfully replaced udev by vdev on our dev1 VMs.  
           Also, we freely ,(without any fear or doubt), and successfully replaced 
           udev by vdev, since we knew we could afford the failure without heavy 
           penalty.  udev is a replacement for the Device File System (DevFS) starting 
           with the Linux 2.6 kernel series

      <h5>P.S.</h5>         

      <P>  In order to end our class at 3.40PM sharp so that everybody had enough time 
       to reboot our system to sda (, the first disk), I forgot to shutdown the dev1 
       VM, the virtual machine we replaced udev by vdev.  Consequence: dev1 rootfs 
       was damaged.  No harm done! I have fixed every Rootfs of this VM in each host.   

      <P> The most severe damaged VM was the one in ac11.  The reason: A lot of attempts 
       of booting dev1 without recovering lan, first.  I fixed it already. Everybody did 
       a good job! Thanks.
